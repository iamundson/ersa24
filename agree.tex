% Overview

AGREE provides a formal contract language for specifying \textit{assumptions} (i.e., expectations on a component's input and the environment) and \textit{guarantees} (i.e., bounds on a component's behavior). AGREE uses a k-induction model checker to prove properties about one layer of an architecture using properties allocated to subcomponents.

AGREE Counterexamples





Component interfaces– The output guarantees of each component must be strong enough to satisfy the input assumptions of downstream components. 

Correctness of implementations– The input assumptions of a system along with the output guarantees of its sub-components must be strong enough to satisfy its output guarantees.
