% Summary

In an effort to make AGREE results more explainable, we have developed AgreeDog, a generative AI-based tool that produces natural language explanations from (potentially complex) AGREE counterexamples.

% Future Work

%   Use AgreeDog to generate AGREE spec statements
Although initial results are encouraging, we will continue to evaluate our approach on increasingly complex models and formal specifications.  In addition, we believe usability of other AGREE features can also benefit from generative AI.  The most obvious candidate is the formalization of AGREE contracts from natural language requirements.   

%   AgreeDog integration with OSATE
Our AgreeDog prototype implementation is currently decoupled from AGREE and OSATE.  In order to truly address AGREE usability, tighter tool integration is required, and will be the focus of upcoming work as we continue to refine the tool.

%   Assurance Dashboard
In addition, INSPECTA will include a DevOps Assurance Dashboard for displaying development status, analysis results and progress towards achieving assurance goals.  The AgreeDog explainable counterexamples will be accessible from the dashboard, and therefore a mechanism will need to be implemented to ensure formatting does not lead to obscuring the explanation in any significant manner.
%   Metrics capture
The dashboard will also capture and display tool usage metrics to help us better understand the degree to which a more explainable analysis result is helpful to the user in terms of leading to a requirement or design fix that then leads to a passing result.

We look forward to sharing the outcome of these efforts in the near future.
