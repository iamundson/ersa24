\begin{abstract}

Formal verification tools such as model checkers have been around for decades, both as research tools and commercially-licensed software.  Unfortunately, despite their ability to prove that mission-critical properties are satisfied in design and implementation, the aerospace and defense industry is still not seeing widespread adoption of these powerful technologies. 

On the other hand, formal methods usage is seeing success in the tech industry

The DARPA PROVERS program was created to replicate that success.

In looking at the possible reasons for slow uptake, difficult cex...

In this paper, we present our notional approach for explainable compositional reasoning using our AGREE tool, along with preliminary feasibility results.
